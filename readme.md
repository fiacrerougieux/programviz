# Program Competencies and SDG Visualization Dashboard

This is a proof-of-concept visualization dashboard that displays program competencies and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) integration across courses. The data used is sourced solely from publicly available UNSW course and program information. [programviz](https://fiacrerougieux.github.io/programviz/).

## Data Sources
- Course descriptions and competency mappings from UNSW Handbook
- SDG mapping derived from public course learning outcomes analysed using large language models
- Program structure and prerequisites from UNSW Handbook

## Features
- Interactive heatmaps showing competency scaffolding across programs
- Cumulative and non-cumulative views
- Radar plots visualizing competency development over program years
- SDG scaffolding visualization
- Course prerequisite flow visualization

## Note
This is a prototype dashboard created for demonstration purposes as part of a cross-faculty collaboration (Engineering, Medicine and Science). A more comprehensive version with additional features and complete data integration is currently under development.

## Disclaimer
This visualization uses only publicly available data from UNSW. The interpretations and mappings are approximate and for demonstration purposes only.

## Future Development
- Integration with other programs, schools, faculties
- Additional analysis tools
- Upload data
- Custom reporting
